  This package contains various servlets.
  <br><br>
  This package depends on the following extra packages to compile and run:
  JavaBeans Activation Framework, JavaMail API and SMTP Extensions (these are
  needed to compile, but only needed to run if you use the FormSenderServlet...
  ignore any errors about missing JARs if you don't use that servlet).
