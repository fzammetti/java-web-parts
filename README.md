The Java Web Parts project 

This is all the source code for the Java Web Parts project, which lives at javawebparts.sourceforge.net.  This is a copy of the current code there, including the web site itself and the cookbook.  I just wanted to have a copy of this off of SF since that site seems to be kind of frowned upon now.

JWP is pretty much a dead project at this point: there hasn't been any work done it in years.  But, there's still actually some useful stuff here (some I use on the job to this day) and it was (if memory serves) my first OSS project that I started, so it still has value as well as historical significance.
