    <h1>NEWS &gt;&gt;&gt;</h1>
    <h3>March 12, 2008</h3>
    <p>Version 1.2 is out now! Version 1.2 contains only changes or fixes to APT. We fixed a bug (#1770034), fixed the FormSender std request handler to properly send POST'd request parameters and modified sample app to demonstrate this. Most important news in this release is the posibility to do cross-domain JSON-P AJAX requests using a jsonp attribute in the ajax-config's <requestHandler> tag. See the sample application for a demo. 
    </p>
    <h3>July 18, 2007</h3>
    <p>The new site is live!
    </p>
    <h3>April 24, 2007</h3>
    <p>Version 1.1 final is now available. No changes from 1.1 beta 1, but now you can feel all warm and fuzzy about not having to use a beta build :)
    </p>
    <h3>April 8, 2007</h3>
    <p>Version 1.1 beta 1 is now available. This release includes a couple of new features and a couple of bug fixes, a good mixture of both. Get it while it's hot :)

    </p>
    <h3>January 1, 2007</h3>
    <p>The first GA release, version 1.0, is in the books! Grab it now! A minor change to the build script
       (that doesn't matter to anyone but the release manager anyway) and a fix to APT's timer tag, and that's it,
       otherwise it's just a straight, stable release. If you've been holding back from using JWP until this milestone,
       well, there you are, have at it!
    </p>
    <h3>November 19, 2006</h3>
    <p>Beta 7 is out! Changes include some bug fixes, a new (simple) javascript compression filter and an
        important change in scope use: APT now uses request scope instead of page scope. This to satisfy the
        users of the tag files where every tag file has is own page scope.
    </p>
    <h3>July 23, 2006</h3>
    <p>Beta 6 is out, go get it now! Changes include a fix for the APT sampleapp page (was misconfigured in
        beta5, so the demo didn't show the ability to use APT in an AJAX response properly), the ability to have
        multiple config files in chain, another fix for APT where config file streams weren't being properly closed,
        and all FindBugs complaints that were legitimate have been addressed.
    </p>
    <h3>July 3, 2006</h3>
    <p>In celebration of freedom and independance, a day early anyway, beta 5 is now unleashed! By far the
        biggest news here is that the AjaxParta Taglib (APT), formerly AjaxTags, is almost entirely a complete rewrite.
        This addresses nearly every request people had for functionality, along with some other things we came up with
        on our own. If you need to do AJAX in as simple and yet powerful a fashion as possible, now is the time to
        take a hard look at APT! There's some other stuff in there as well of course, as always, check out the
        release notes. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h3>February 26, 2006</h3>
    <p>Beta 4 now available. This release is devoted almost entirely to AjaxTags enhancements. We have
        addressed a number of commonly-asked questions and expanded the functionality a fair bit. Also contains
        some new functionality in the JSTags taglib and some other places.
    </p>
    <h3>January 23, 2006</h3>
    <p>Beta 3 has been released! Another significant release, including: fixed an undefined behavior in
        AjaxTags with regard to target URLs, the ability to have multiple ajax-config files and the ability to have
        static parameters in target URLs for AjaxTags, the CoR implementation can now read config files in JARs, added
        JSDigester to the JSTags taglib (this is a client-side implementation of Commons Digester), added the popup
        calender widget to UIWidgets and dealt with some bugs, and a bunch of other stuff!
    </p>
    <h3>January 8, 2006</h3>
    <p>The first release of the New Year is here, beta 2! This has a pretty long list of changes and additions,
        including some new AjaxTags functionality, a new servlet, a new filter and some important fixes. Happy New Year!
    </p>
    <h3>December 18, 2005</h3>
    <p>Java Web Parts is now officially a beta release! Woo-hoo! This version includes a couple of bug fixes as
        well as a few new additions (mostly in AjaxTags).
    </p>
    <h3>December 5, 2005</h3>
    <p>A new AjaxTags RequestHandler, a handy new method in RequestHelpers and some other stuff.
   </p>
   <h3>November 26, 2005</h3>
   <p>v.14 released. It's been nearly a month since the last release, and while there aren't a large number of
        changes in this release, they are fairly significant: multiple simultaneous AJAX events with AjaxTags are now
        supported, and the DependencyFilter now allows you to set a path on each request-scoped dependency, so you can
        have your beans only created on the request paths you want them creaed on!
