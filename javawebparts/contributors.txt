People who have contributed to Java Web Parts
---------------------------------------------

It is very important to me that all those who contribute to the project in any
way get credit for their contributions.  To help do that, I've added this file
to the distribution.

Here is the list of contributors to date, in no particular order, with at least
a partial list of what they have contributed:

* Frank W. Zammetti
  Project founder and developer.

* Tamas Szabo
  Tamas is a project developer.

* Herman van Rosmalen
  Herman is a project developer.

* Wendy Smoak
  Some various code submissions and suggestions.

* Aron Gombas
  Contributed a patch to fix some typos and implement more robust logging.

* Günther Wieser
  Found and resolved some issues under Resin.

* Ricky Tong
  Contributed the stdXSLT handler, and some other contributions as well.

* Zaid A. Omar
  Contributed an AjaxParts Taglib enhancement to allow for execution of script
  blocks returned and handled with the stdInnerHTML handler.

* William Vuong
  Discovered the problem with the CompressionFilter that caused it to not work
  with forwards, and helped track down the problem.

* Keith Ulrich
  Discovered a problem with the TLDs, as well as a problem with the AjaxParts
  Taglib demo page in Firefox.

* Colin Kilburn
  Submitted a patch to put all APT stuff that previously went into page scope
  into request scope instead.

* Luigi Bitonti
  Submitted a patch to deal with an error that occurred in JWPGetElementValue
  when a <select> element had no options and also a bug caused by global vars
  in stdPoster.

* Yannick Haudry
  Contributed a patch for RequestHelpers to get all values for a given
  parameter, not just the first (i.e., two parameters named "param" should
  result in an array of values, but before this patch you would only get the
  first one).  Also contributed a patch for IPAccessControlFilter to allow
  regex against addressList and retrieval of client IP from a header so the
  filter can work behind load balancers.

* Zack Shapiro
  Suggested the idea behind the patch to the IPAccessControlFilter by
  Yannick Haudry.

* Darren King
  Provided patch to implement the attachTo attribute on the <ajax:event/> tag.
  Also provided a patch to make the std:selectbox handler a bit more robust
  under Firefox.

* Carl Manaster
  Found a documentation bug in the IPAccessControlFilter.

* James Ottot
  Provided a fix for an exception in JSCompressionFilter under WebLogic.

* Gerald Schulzendorff
  Provided a fix for matchPattern problems and stdRedirecter problems.  Also
  pointed out that stdRedirecter was written as stdRedirector in docs.

Thanks to every that has contributed, and keep 'em coming!  Contributions are
always welcome here at Java Web Parts!
