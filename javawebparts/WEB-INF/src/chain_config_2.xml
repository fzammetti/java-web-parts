<!-- A Chain configuration file example to go along with the sample app. -->
<!-- Note that the ChainManager, which is the class responsible for      -->
<!-- parsing this file, expects to find this file always named           -->
<!-- chain_config.xml somewhere in the classpath.  In a wenapp this is   -->
<!-- most easily accomplished by placing it in WEB-INF/classes.  The     -->
<!-- JWP build script copies this file from WEB-INF/src to               -->
<!-- WEB-INF/classes as part of its normal processing, that's why this   -->
<!-- isn't simply in WEB-INf with the other config files.                -->
