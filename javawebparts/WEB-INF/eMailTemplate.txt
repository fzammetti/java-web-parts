Dear ${firstName} ${lastName},

  It has come to our attention that you have not paid the bill for your pet
${petName}.  We must therefore ask that you remit payment in full no later than
seven business days after receipt of this message.  If you do not comply, we
will unleash the demons from the pits of Hell to reposess ${petName}, as well
as generally hurt you in many gruesome ways.

  Have a nice today and a pleasant tomorrow.

                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Satan's Family Pet Shop
